halo
====

A framework for building apps that deal with third-party data. Halo provides the basic components to the server side portion of a mobile or web app whose main function is fetching data from third-party apis like twitter and facebook. Halo comes with functionality like third-party authentication, managing of multiple accounts, push notifications, in-app purchases, stripe subscriptions, user registration including password reset, and email confirmation functionality built-in. It aims to be a minimalist framework built upon flask, peewee, and many other libraries.
